description: Defining Load Network

# Overview

### Abstract

Load Network is a high performance blockchain for onchain data storage - cheaply and verifiably store and access any data .

As a high-performance data-centric EVM network, Load Network maximizes scale and transparency for L1s, L2s and data-intensive dApps. Load Network is dedicated to solving the problem of onchain data storage.\
\
Load Network offloads storage to Arweave, and achieve high performance computation -decoupled from the EVM L1 itself- by utilizing ao-hyperbeam custom devices, giving any other chain a way to easily plug in a robust permanent storage layer powered by a hyperscalable network of EVM nodes with bleeding edge throughput capacity.&#x20;

### Load Network is ex-WeaveVM Network

Before March 2025, Load Network (abbreviations: LOAD or LN) was named WeaveVM Network (WVM). All existing references to WeaveVM (naming, links, etc.) in the documentation should be treated as Load Network.
