# Network Releases Nomenclature

{% hint style="info" %}
Both Alphanets and Devnets are testnet networks with no monetary value tied to the Load Network mainnet. They serve different purposes in our development pipeline
{% endhint %}

### Alphanets: Stable Testnets&#x20;

* Designed for user/dev exploration and testing.
* Features low frequency of breaking changes.
* Provides a more reliable environment for developers and users to interact with Load Network.

### Devnets: Experimental Testnets&#x20;

* Acts as a testing ground for the Alphanets.
* Characterized by frequent breaking changes and potential instability.
* Playground for testing new features, EIPs, and experimental concepts.
