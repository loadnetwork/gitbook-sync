# Cloud Platform (LCP)

Uploading data onchain shouldn’t be any more difficult than using Google Drive. The reason tools like Google Drive are popular is because they just work and are cheap/free. Their hidden downsides? You don’t own your data, it’s not permanent, and – especially for blockchain projects – it’s not useful for application developers.

Users just want to put their data somewhere and forget about the upkeep. Developers just want a permanent reference to their data that resolves in any environment. Whichever you are, we built [cloud.load.network](http://cloud.load.network/) for you.

The Load Cloud is an all-in-one tool to interact with various Load Network storage interfaces and pipelines: one UI, one API key, various integrations, with web2 UX.

Using the API keys generated on cloud.load.network - you can access other features such as load0 and Load S3 storage.

### The Rationale

Since we started Load Network, we’ve had the vision of an onchain data center – a decentralized network of high performance, cost effectiveness, high-liveness, fault tolerance, low latency and fast finalization, data-centric features and availability.

Building a cloud platform, similar to Google Cloud Platform, means abstracting the robust infrastructure of the (onchain) data center into a single UI, providing a smooth – as straightforward as using Google Cloud Platform to interface with their several services, that are built on top of their robust infrastructure of data centers and what comes along it.

In today’s web3 world, too many teams relies on third-party hosted-IPFS pinning services (e.g. pinata, nft.storage), AWS S3 object storage and its alternatives (Google Cloud Bucket, etc), and other centralized data storage solutions – they are compromising the decentralization and liveness needed for permanent apps for ephemeral unsustainable short-term solutions.

Other teams are already using battle-tested web3 native solutions such as Arweave and Filecoin, however these protocols lack the unification of a single cloud platform that lets developers use them like they’d use AWS S3. This creates engineering overhead for teams to integrate with web3 native solutions, keeping web3 devs in the web2 trap. We’re solving this with the Load Cloud.

### Introducing Load Network Cloud Platform: Going Onchain

As a response to the lack of web3 storage solution abstraction and interoperability with the web2 standard interfaces, we have worked on the Load Cloud, a one stop solution to use existing data storage standards, without compromising the core features of web3 data storage provided by Load Network.
