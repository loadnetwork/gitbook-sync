# Load S3 Agentic Storage

It would be best if _absolutely everything_ was immortalized onchain forever… but it’s just not practical. Permanent data is around [$0.015 per MB](https://ar-fees.arweave.net/). Not expensive for something vitally important that needs to live for 200 years; very expensive for a few hidden gems amid terabytes of garbage.

In an ideal world, we’d have a way to automatically determine an artifact’s significance before making it permanent. But how do we know what is worth keeping forever?

One idea we had at [Decent Land Labs](https://decent.land/) was an agent-based way to plug into a temporary storage layer and immortalize some of its data on Arweave if certain conditions were met.&#x20;

Let's explore the current Load S3 data storage agents list.
