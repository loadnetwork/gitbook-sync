# EVM Bundler (legacy)

**Since** [**Load S3** ](../../load-cloud-platform-lcp/load-s3-layer-ls3.md)**and**[ **Load Cloud Platform**](../../load-cloud-platform-lcp/cloud-platform-lcp.md) **launch, we advise using them instead of EVM Bundler for several reasons:**

* Arweave's ANS-104 compatibility
* S3 object-storage compatibility
* Highly-scalable, cost-efficient temporary storage
* Powered by AO and HyperBEAM
* Equipped with a bigger set of dev tools and APIs, offering higher stability

However, we will keep this legacy section for EVM Bundlers in the docs for backward compatibility.
