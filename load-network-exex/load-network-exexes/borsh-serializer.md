# Borsh Serializer

### About

[Borsh](https://github.com/near/borsh) stands for Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing and is a binary serializer developed by the [NEAR](https://near.org) team. It is designed for security-critical projects, prioritizing consistency, safety, and speed, and comes with a strict specification.&#x20;

The ExEx utilizes Borsh to serialize and deserialize block objects, ensuring a bijective mapping between objects and their binary representations. [Get the ExEx code](https://github.com/weaveVM/wvm-reth/tree/main/wvm-apps/wvm-exexed/crates/wevm-borsh)
