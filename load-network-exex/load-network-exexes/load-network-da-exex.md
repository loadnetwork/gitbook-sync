# Load Network DA ExEx

### About

This introduces a new DA interface for EVM rollups that doesn't require changes to the sequencer or network architecture. It's easily added to any Reth client with just 80 lines of code by importing the DA ExEx code into the ExExes directory, making integration simple and seamless. [Get the code here](https://github.com/weaveVM/wvm-reth/tree/dev/wvm-apps/wvm-exexed/crates/exex-wvm-da) & [installing setup guide here](../../load-network-for-evm-chains/da-exex-reth-only.md)
