# Arweave Data Uploader

### About

This ExEx is the first data upload pipeline between an Ethereum client (reth) and Arweave, the permanent data storage network. The ExEx uses [AR.IO Turbo Bundler](https://ardrive.io/turbo-bundler/) to bundle data and send it to Arweave. [Get the ExEx code](https://github.com/weaveVM/wvm-reth/tree/main/wvm-apps/wvm-exexed/crates/irys).
