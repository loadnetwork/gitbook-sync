### About

[ExEx.rs](https://exex.rs) is an open source directory for Reth's ExExes. You can think of it as an "chainlist of ExExes".

We believe that curating ExExes will accelerate their development by making examples and templates easily discoverable. [Add you ExEx today!](https://github.com/weaveVM/exex.rs?tab=readme-ov-file#add-an-exex-object)
