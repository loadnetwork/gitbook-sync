## About LOAD1 AVS

`LOAD1` AVS will be built to decentralize Load Network gateway stack and create a robust network of packed gateway+bundler nodes.

Built using EigenLayer and LN's Bundler data protocol, LOAD1 will bring LN's permanent data  to the EigenLayer ecosystem, delivering the first permanent data storage solution with near-instant data availability and incentivized data serving.

LOAD1 operators will offer 2 main services: data bundling (0xbabe2 storage) and data serving (0xbabe2 optimistic caching and native reconstruction from Load Network).
