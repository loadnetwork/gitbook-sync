# About LaoD Modular Framework

### About

LoaD modular framework is the first shared sequencing framework that makes ao and any EVM chain interoperable, creating a bidirectional data pipeline, facilitating new possibilities such as trustless assets bridging, cross communication, and adding decentralization to single-sequencer EVM networks.

### What EVM interop enables for ao

* Trustless asset bridging: ERC20s <> AO tokens with no centralised third party
* Access to the whole EVM dApp ecosystem – Uniswap, Maker, identity/reputation layers, common NFT standards (ERC721), liquidity, etc.
* Agents with permissionless access to an EVM compatible wallet, tooling, assets
* Access to evergrowing L1s and L2s ecosystem resources (users, generated historical data, capital, developers, etc)
* (ao leveraged EVM -ethereum- for liquidity access in the ao token fair-launch)

### What ao interop enables for EVMs (including Load Network)

* Access to the most advanced decentralized agents – Solidity limitations bypassed by ao’s WASM processes
* EVMs access to ao’s financial ecosystem (liquidity, defi agents, etc)
* Offloading heavy and complex EVM compute to ao trustlessly.
* Offer ao’s altDA in the EVM’s rollup stack (L2s for L1 and L3s for L2s) – modularity: e.g. OP-stack on Load Network with access to ao’s altDA
* Decentralizing the rollup’s single sequencer model (JSON-RPC based single sequencer – censorable)

### Terminology

LaoD (pronounced as /loʊd/) naming comes from the framework initiative being led by Load Network, and the action of "loading" ao onto an EVM network (load ao).

### LoaD Framework vs EVM natively on ao

ao is a data protocol, compute layer agnostic, therefore building an EVM compute layer is totally possible but with constraints (full EVM compatibility, processes cross communication, custom-making the battle-tested EVM ELs and CLs, etc). Therefore, we at Load Network (under Decent Land Labs), are looking at the "EVM on ao" angle differently: make any EVM network interoperable with ao via shared sequencing, and load.network will be the first client of this framework.

Therefore, instead of reinventing the EVM wheel by trying to make it work natively on ao, we are creating a modular EVM shared sequencing framework that can let any EVM network - come with its finely tuned edges and capabilities, with no tradeoffs – to plugin with ao, leverage it for decentralized and performant shared sequencing and benefit from the data interoperability gained by the shared sequencing on ao.
